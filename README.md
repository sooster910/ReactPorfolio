# New Portfolio with React (2020)
### Recently, I decided to leave my legacy portfolio built in 2018, and create new portfolio with React. 
### This website will be focused on :
 ..* Mobile First Design 
 ..* Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
 
 _More features will be updated._ 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
